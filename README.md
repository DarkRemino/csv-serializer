# A small command-line tool written in C designed to compress specific CSV data

This tool was made by me as a course project in TU - Sofia for the Basic Programming Languages course.
It is designed to take a specific CSV file (which you can find in the repo itself), compress it as much as possible and then make it binary for transmitting.
